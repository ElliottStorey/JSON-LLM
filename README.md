A tool for structuring inputs and outputs of large language models. The real power of generative language AI is in using the data programatically, for machine usage & consumption.

* Strict typing for data means more accurate responses
* Less verbose, therefore less expensive
* More predictable outputs
* Only one way to interpret input
